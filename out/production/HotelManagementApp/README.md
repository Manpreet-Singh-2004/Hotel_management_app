## ðŸ”¶ Functional Gaps To Implement

- [x] **Housekeeping Task Scheduling**  
  Implement a `Housekeeping` module to auto-flag rooms for cleaning post check-out and track cleaning status. Include deep cleaning or maintenance flagging options. - Shreyas

- [ ] **Dynamic Room Assignment During Check-In**  
  Assign rooms automatically based on availability and guest preferences (e.g., room type, floor). Real-time updates to room status needed.

- [ ] **Guest History Tracking**  
  Maintain records of past stays, including preferences, billing history, and feedback, for personalized experiences and promotions.

- [ ] **Group Reservations with Shared Billing**  
  Allow booking multiple rooms in one reservation, with billing options: single invoice for the group or individual billing per guest.

- [ ] **Late Check-Out Handling Logic**  
  Implement logic to process late check-outs: extend reservation, adjust housekeeping schedule, and apply extra charges.

- [ ] **Seasonal Pricing Adjustments**  
  Introduce dynamic pricing based on season, local events, or occupancy. UI support for setting date-based pricing rules is required.
